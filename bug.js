```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind's `flex` utility class to create a horizontal flexbox. However, if the content inside the divs expands beyond their assigned width (`w-1/2`), it can cause unexpected layout issues.  The `flex` utility doesn't inherently wrap content, leading to overflowing elements.
